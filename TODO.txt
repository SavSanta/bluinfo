# Potential TODOs
- See if extension to support the slowly rising UHD (4K resolution/2160p, HDMV0300 format) possible
- In the same vein I need to determine Aspect Ratios for different UHD formats (UHD -> 16:9, UHDWK -> resolution 3840 Ã— 1600 but 12:5 Aspect Ratio, etc)
- In the same vein see about detecting and supporting H.265/x265/HEVC
- Make more standard string names for human output ie (DTS -> Dolby True Surround)
- Clean up program to follow the standard Python formats (ie 80 character screen, standard naming conventions, __init__ == main, etc)
- Colorize the command output like wifite.py
- Change my return None and associated checks into exception raised and handled
- Convert TCL/TK GUI to Tkinter
- Add logging module for info output
- Think about turning the methods defined functions in the ts_streamtype classes (like convertvideformat, convertsamplerate, etc) into property (methods that compute their value when access)
- Make program faster https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17137490/pythonic-enumeration-of-while-loop#17137764
- Maybe support the edgecase AVCHD FAT32/UDF ( Slight different extensions on core files MPL, CLP, BDM, etc)
- Replace os.path with pathlib if it is possibly better
- Investigate if on Linux/Mac if we need to provide a permanent or temporary file renamer (for BDMV/STREAM/CLIPINF/BDJO, etc) because the case sensitivity impacts these systems but I dont want to alter the hash of say torrents or system pointers.
- MKV
