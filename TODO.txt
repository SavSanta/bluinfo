# Potential TODOs

- See if I need to explicitly write out the full qualified paths for the ts_streamerclass.py classes
when I call them in other classes functions/methods. I tested it in IDLE and it worked fine as is but what about from another module? What about from a module that only import's the certain foo function or class it needs?
- See if extension to support the slowly rising UHD (4K resolution/2160p, HDMV0300 format) possible
- In the same vein I need to determine Aspect Ratios for different UHD formats (UHD -> 16:9, UHDWK -> resolution 3840 Ã— 1600 but 12:5 Aspect Ratio, etc)
- In the same vein see about detecting and supporting H.265/x265/HEVC
- Make more standard string names for human output ie (DTS -> Dolby True Surround)
- Clean up program to follow the standard Python formats (ie 80 character screen, standard naming conventions, __init__ == main, etc)
- Colorize the command output like wifite.py
- Figure out better naming conventions
- Change my  return None and associated checks into exception raised and handled
- GUI design
- Think about turning the methods defined functions in the ts_streamtype classes (like convertvideformat, convertsamplerate, etc) into property (methods that computer their value when access)
- Make program faster https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips
- Investigate if I can use in the MPLS laylist reader portion an actual StreamReader that remembers the last position instead of a list (as im doing with the pos variable since Python doesnt support a ref keyword).
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17137490/pythonic-enumeration-of-while-loop#17137764
- Maybe support the edgecase AVCHD FAT32/UDF ( Slight different extensions on core files MPL, CLP, BDM, etc)
- Replace os.path with pathlib if it is possibly better
- Investigate if on Linux/Mac if we need to provide a permanent or temporary file renamer (for BDMV/STREAM/CLIPINF/BDJO, etc) because the case sensitivity impacts these systems but I dont want to alter the hash of say torrents or system pointers.
- The createplaylist and debug_stream section where we set the variable doesnt actually work at all because I ued the wrong variable names. However, since it never crashes or otherwise interferes with the program, I guess I'll leave it as a known issue as it's only useful for detecting/marking hidden streams in my interest.
